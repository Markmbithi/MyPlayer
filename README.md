# MyPlayer
This is a very simple app that streams a live video to a mobile app. I am using the bambuser.com SDK. This particular project is for Android and can run on any device starting from Android 6 all the way up to Android 9. 

Fork this folder into your PC, open the project with Android Studio and setup the necessary libraries and AVD as required.

# Setup steps;
1. Clone this folder to your desktop machine.
2. Create a bambuser.com account. We will use this account to extract our ApplicationId and API Key.
3.
