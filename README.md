# MyPlayer
This is a very simple app that streams a live video to a mobile app. I am using the bambuser.com SDK. This particular project is for Android and can run on any device starting from Android 6 all the way up to Android 9. 

Fork this folder into your PC, open the project with Android Studio and setup the necessary libraries and AVD as required.

# Setup steps;
1. Clone this folder to your desktop machine.
2. Create a bambuser.com account. We will use this account to extract our ApplicationId and API Key.
3. Download this Android SDK that is usefull to make this application work. https://backend.irisplatform.io/api/downloads/231?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE1NjM3NTk5NTEsImRvd25sb2FkZXIiOiJtYXJrbWJpbGFAZ21haWwuY29tIn0.0EpyUSp5j6c3N00oWjdZtVGBgrV-UCh9-sDokMyh8hI
